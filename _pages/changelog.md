Reading Time is a privacy focused read-it-later application.
There are no trackers, no analytics, no account, no login. All your articles are stored on your device. 
If you happen to have an Apple account you can sync your saved articles via Apples iCloud.

Articles can be stored from everywhere on your iPhone or your iPad and are saved on device.
This way we can provide you with a beautiful reading experience which also works when you are offline.

How about reading some of the articles you found online while having a coffee break?
